          About me:<br />
          Milene is a Copenhagen-based poet who draws inspiration from her life as a woman in the contemporary world. Her writing encompasses the lyrical, bodily expressions, the fluidity of water and inner landscapes.

          As a yoga teacher and an acupuncturist, she finds inspiration in these holistic views. Through her words, she incorporates movement, circularity, and the pulsations that move us. <br /><br />
          She invokes values such as sensitivity or frailty, and collapsing as a way to persist. She initiates a spur for the feminine to breathe and unfold. To find strength in being a woman and unison in our experience.

            <br />Poem of the month:<br /><br /><br />
            Hope<br /><br />
            He drew a line<br />
            A streak on a page<br />
            A parting in the sand<br />
            She drew a circle<br />
            The line was taken<br />
            Into the world<br />
            And the earth was broken<br />
            Into lands<br />
            His story<br />
            Became history<br />
            And her circle was lost<br />
            Some say they've seen<br />
            Rings in the sand<br />
            Or spheres hanging Over closed lids<br />
            I bet they're on to something<br />
            An exit<br />
            Throats widening<br />
            Like two dancers<br />
            Drawing circles<br />
            To a beating heart<br /><br />
